## 🔧 Configuration

### Current Settings:

```javascript
// src/utils/constants.js
export const API_ENDPOINTS = {
  BASE_URL: 'https://aaee6cac33e5.ngrok-free.app',
  SOCKET_URL: 'https://aaee6cac33e5.ngrok-free.app', // ← Socket server
  // ...
};
```

### For Production:

Update `SOCKET_URL` to your production server URL.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

### Connection Flow:

```
1. User logs in
   ↓
2. AuthContext saves token
   ↓
3. SocketProvider detects authentication
   ↓
4. Socket connects with token
   ↓
5. Socket subscribes to 'orders'
   ↓
6. OrderContext sets up event listeners
   ↓
7. App receives real-time updates
```

### Event Flow Example (Order Assignment):

```
Admin assigns order (API call)
         ↓
Backend emits: socket.emit('order:assigned', data)
         ↓
Driver app receives event
         ↓
OrderContext handler: handleOrderAssigned()
         ↓
Dispatch: ADD_NEW_ORDER
         ↓
React state updates
         ↓
UI re-renders with new order
         ↓
Toast notification shows
         ↓
Agent sees new order! 🎉
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Test Commands:

**Test Connection:**
```bash
# Run app and check logs
npm run android
# or
npm run ios

# Look for:
✅ Socket Connected - ID: abc123
```

**Test Order Assignment:**
```bash
curl -X PUT https://your-api.com/api/orders/123/assign-agent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agentId": "agent-456"}'
```

**Test Force Logout:**
```bash
curl -X PUT https://your-api.com/api/auth/users/123/block \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"isBlocked": true}'
```

| Emoji | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 🔌 | Connection | `🔌 Connecting to Socket.IO server...` |
| ✅ | Success | `✅ Socket Connected - ID: abc123` |
| ❌ | Disconnection | `❌ Socket Disconnected` |
| 📦 | Orders | `📦 ORDER ASSIGNED: {...}` |
| 🔄 | Status Update | `🔄 ORDER STATUS UPDATED: {...}` |
| 🎧 | Listeners | `🎧 Setting up Order Socket Listeners...` |
| 🧹 | Cleanup | `🧹 Cleaning up Order Socket Listeners...` |
| 🚫 | Force Logout | `🚫 Force Logout Event: {...}` |
| 🔴 | Error | `🔴 Socket Connection Error: ...` |
| ⚠️ | Warning | `⚠️ Socket not connected yet` |

## 🎯 Production Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] Update `SOCKET_URL` in constants.js to production URL
- [ ] Test socket connection on real devices
- [ ] Test all socket events (assign, status, delivery, logout)
- [ ] Verify auto-reconnection works
- [ ] Test on both iOS and Android
- [ ] Check battery consumption with persistent connection
- [ ] Verify force logout works correctly
- [ ] Test with poor network conditions
- [ ] Monitor console logs in production (optional)
- [ ] Setup error tracking (Sentry, etc.)

---

## 🎉 Success Metrics

### What You Can Now Do:

1. ✅ **Assign orders instantly** - Agents see orders the moment they're assigned
2. ✅ **Track in real-time** - Status updates happen immediately
3. ✅ **Instant confirmations** - Delivery completions are reflected instantly
4. ✅ **Security enforcement** - Blocked agents are logged out immediately
5. ✅ **System announcements** - Broadcast messages to all agents
6. ✅ **Offline resilience** - Auto-reconnection when network returns

---

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Token-based authentication** - Socket requires valid JWT
2. **Role-based filtering** - Agents only see their orders
3. **Force logout** - Immediate logout on account block
4. **Secure transport** - WSS in production
5. **Session management** - Clean disconnection on logout

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Issue:** Socket not connecting  
**Solution:** Check SOCKET_URL, backend server, and auth token

**Issue:** Events not received  
**Solution:** Verify socket.connected === true and subscription

**Issue:** Duplicate notifications  
**Solution:** Check useEffect cleanup functions

**Issue:** Force logout not working  
**Solution:** Verify useForceLogout() is called

---

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Battery Impact:** Minimal with WebSocket (keep-alive pings)
- **Data Usage:** Very low (only events, no polling)
- **Memory:** Efficient (single connection, event-driven)
- **Reconnection:** Automatic with exponential backoff
- **Scalability:** Ready for 1000+ concurrent agents

---

## 🎓 Learning Resources

To understand the implementation:

1. Start with: `SOCKET_SETUP_QUICK_START.md`
2. Deep dive: `SOCKET_INTEGRATION.md`
3. Reference: `SOCKET_EVENTS_REFERENCE.md`
4. Code: Check `src/utils/socket.js` and `src/context/SocketContext.js`

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements (Optional)

Ideas for extending functionality:

- [ ] Typing indicators (agent is typing notes)
- [ ] Read receipts (agent saw the order)
- [ ] Live location sharing (agent location to customer)
- [ ] Chat between agent and customer
- [ ] Voice/video call integration
- [ ] Push notifications integration
- [ ] Analytics events tracking
