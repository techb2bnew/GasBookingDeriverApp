```
App (Root)
├── AuthProvider
│   └── SocketProvider (connects on auth)
│       ├── LocationProvider
│       │   └── OrderProvider (listens to socket events)
│       │       └── AppNavigator

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Test Connection

Run the app and check console logs:

```
✅ Socket Connected - ID: abc123
📦 Subscribing to order updates
🎧 Setting up Order Socket Listeners...
```

### 2. Test Order Assignment

Use your admin panel or Postman:

```bash
PUT /api/orders/:orderId/assign-agent
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "agentId": "your-agent-id"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Agent receives `order:assigned` event
- Toast notification appears: "New Order Assigned! 🎉"
- Order appears in available orders list

### 3. Test Order Status Update

```bash
PUT /api/orders/:orderId/status
Authorization: Bearer {agent_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "out_for_delivery",
  "agentNotes": "On the way"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Agent receives `order:status-updated` event
- Toast notification: "Order status: out_for_delivery"
- Order status updates in UI

### 4. Test Order Delivery

```bash
POST /api/orders/:orderId/verify-otp
Authorization: Bearer {agent_token}
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

{
  "otp": "123456",
  "deliveryProof": <image_file>,
  "paymentReceived": true,
  "deliveryNote": "Delivered successfully"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Agent receives `order:delivered` event
- Success toast: "Delivery Completed! 🎉"
- Order removed from active list
- Navigates to dashboard

### 5. Test Force Logout

```bash
PUT /api/auth/users/:userId/block
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "isBlocked": true
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Agent receives `user:force-logout` event
- Alert dialog appears with message
- Agent is logged out automatically
- Navigates to login screen

## 📱 Real App Usage

### For Delivery Agents:

1. **Login to app** → Socket connects automatically
2. **Go online** → Subscribes to order updates
3. **Receive order** → Get notification when assigned
4. **Accept order** → Order status updates in real-time
5. **Complete delivery** → Get instant confirmation
6. **Logout** → Socket disconnects cleanly

### Automatic Features:

✅ **Auto-reconnection** - If network drops, socket reconnects automatically  
✅ **Force logout** - If admin blocks account, agent is logged out immediately  
✅ **Real-time sync** - All order updates happen instantly  
✅ **Notifications** - Toast messages for all important events

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Socket not connecting

**Check:**
1. Backend server is running
2. SOCKET_URL in constants.js is correct
3. Auth token is valid
4. Network connectivity

**Console should show:**
```
🔌 Connecting to Socket.IO server...
✅ Socket Connected - ID: abc123
```

### Problem: Not receiving events

**Check:**
1. Socket is connected: Look for "✅ Socket Connected"
2. Subscribed to orders: Look for "📦 Subscribing to order updates"
3. Event name is correct (case-sensitive)
4. Backend is emitting events

**Debug with:**
```javascript
socket.onAny((eventName, data) => {
  console.log('Received:', eventName, data);
});
```

### Problem: Force logout not working

**Check:**
1. useForceLogout() hook is called in component
2. Socket is connected
3. Backend emits the event correctly
